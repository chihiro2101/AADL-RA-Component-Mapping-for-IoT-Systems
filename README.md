# **AADL–RA Component Mapping for IoT Systems**

This repository contains a curated dataset for studying and evaluating the mapping between **AADL architectural models** and a **Reference Architecture (RA)** for **IoT devices**.
It is designed to support research on **model alignment, architecture synthesis, and component-level correspondence** between system designs and a domain reference model.

The dataset provides:

* A formal **IoT Reference Architecture**
* A collection of **AADL system models**
* **Ground-truth mappings** between AADL components and RA components

## RA (Reference Architecture)

The **RA** folder defines the Reference Architecture for IoT systems.

| File                   | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `iot.ecore`            | Ecore metamodel defining the structure of the IoT Reference Architecture |
| `iot.gram`             | Grammar file for parsing and processing the RA                           |
| `iot_ra_component.txt` | Textual description of the functionality of each RA component            |
| `iot.png`              | Visual diagram of the IoT Reference Architecture                         |

This RA represents a domain-level view of how IoT systems are structured and how responsibilities are distributed among components.

---

## AADL_models

This folder contains **AADL system models** in `.aaxl2` format.

Each file represents a concrete IoT system architecture expressed in AADL.

**File naming convention:**

```text
<model_name>.aaxl2
```

Each model corresponds to a mapping file and a visualization in the `Component_mapping` folder.

---

## Component_mapping

This folder provides the **ground-truth alignment** between AADL models and the IoT Reference Architecture.

It contains two subfolders:

### `mapping_files/`

JSON files describing how AADL components map to RA components.

Each file:

```text
mapping_<model_name>.json
```

corresponds to:

```text
AADL_models/<model_name>.aaxl2
```

These mappings explicitly state which AADL components implement or correspond to which RA components.

---

### `mapping_png/`

Visual representations of the mappings.

Each PNG file:

```text
mapping_<model_name>.png
```

is a graphical illustration of the JSON mapping, making it easier to understand the alignment between the system model and the reference architecture.

---

## Purpose of the Dataset

This repository is intended for:

* Evaluating **architecture-to-RA mapping algorithms**
* Supporting **architecture synthesis and consistency checking**

The provided mappings are **manually curated ground truth**, enabling both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of automated techniques.

---

## Experimental Procedure

The ground-truth mappings in this repository were validated through a controlled human annotation process.
Details of the experimental setting, materials, workload distribution, and data aggregation protocol
are described in a separate document:
